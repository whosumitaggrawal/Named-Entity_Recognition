# Named-Entity_Recognition
This project is centered around Named Entity Recognition (NER) using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, leveraging the power of spaCy and Gradio. The primary objective of this project is to create an AI-driven application capable of identifying and extracting named entities within text data.

The application initiates by processing user-provided text through spaCy, a powerful NLP library. SpaCy's pre-trained models are employed to analyze the input text comprehensively.

Within spaCy, the NER model is activated, and it scrutinizes the text for various named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. These recognized entities are annotated with their corresponding labels, offering valuable insights into the structure and content of the text.

The Gradio library is seamlessly integrated into the project to craft an intuitive user interface. This interface empowers users to input text and trigger the NER process with ease. The recognized named entities are presented as the output, along with their respective labels, providing users with a clear and organized view of the entities identified within the text.

A helpful description accompanies the interface, guiding users on how to utilize the application efficiently and understand the significance of named entity recognition in various contexts.

The NER project boasts wide-ranging applications across diverse domains. It can be instrumental in automating information extraction from unstructured text, facilitating data categorization, enhancing information retrieval, and assisting in content analysis. By harnessing NER capabilities, users gain the ability to identify and categorize critical elements within text data, streamlining various text-based tasks.

Overall, this project illustrates the fusion of spaCy and Gradio to build a robust NER application. It offers an accessible and potent solution for identifying named entities within text, paving the way for improved text analysis and enhanced information extraction in a multitude of applications.
